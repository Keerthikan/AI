\section{Introduction}
This report documents the work done to create a sokoban solving robot. 
The report is divided into two sections, one describing the robot and the software of the robot, and one describing the solver.
Throughout the first part the considerations concerning the physical aspects of the robot will be discussed.
Additionally a short overview of the robot software will be presented.
The second part will discuss the various aspects of the solver, including the algorithm used, as well as some of the optimizations done to increase the speed of the solver.
